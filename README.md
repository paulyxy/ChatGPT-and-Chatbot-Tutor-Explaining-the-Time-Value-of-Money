A good understanding of the concept of Time Value of Money (TVM) will lay down a solid 
  foundation to study finance further. In this paper, we show five ways to explain TVM:
  traditional way (in a classroom setting), free financial and mortgage calculators, 
  ChatGPT (general format), ChatGPT based on a user’s own PDF file (such as this paper),
   and Chatbot. Performaces of the last four methods are compared in terms of explaining
  5 formulae: pv(one fv), fv(pv), pv(perpetuity), pv(annuity), and fv(annuity). 

The results show that Chatbot plus a financial calculator might be the best solution.
   In addition, our financial calculator also mimics five Excel functions: pv(), fv(),
   pmt(), rate(), and nper().  Our Chatbot and financial calculator are written in Python
   and the interface is based on the streamlit Python package. The beauty of our method is
   that students and teachers don’t need any prior knowledge related to Python. A few basic
   Python prorams are included in the appendices for interested readers.
